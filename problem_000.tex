Suppose $V$ is a vector space and $S,~T~\in~\mathcal{L}(V)$.  
Prove that if $ST$ is injective then $S$ is injective.
Prove that if $ST$ is surjective then $T$ is surjective.

This is the ``easy'' way.\\
Assume $V = S \oplus U$ and $V = S \oplus W$.\\
Since $V = S \oplus U$, we have that $\textmd{dim}(V) =\textmd{dim}(S) +\textmd{dim}(U).$\\
Since $V = S \oplus W$, we have that $\textmd{dim}(V) =\textmd{dim}(S) +\textmd{dim}(W).$\\
We therefore see that $\textmd{dim}(U) = \textmd{dim}(W).$

\noindent \framebox{$\Leftarrow$}\\
Assume $\textmd{dim}(U) = \textmd{dim}(W).$\\
{\color{blue} We want to prove that that there exists $S$, a subspace of $V$, such that $V = S \oplus U$ and $V = S \oplus W$.}\\

To bring some intuition let us think 
$$
V=\mathbb{R}^3,\quad
U= \textmd{Span}(\left(\begin{array}{c}1\\0\\0\end{array}\right),\left(\begin{array}{c}0\\1\\0\end{array}\right)), \quad
W= \textmd{Span}(\left(\begin{array}{c}1\\0\\0\end{array}\right),\left(\begin{array}{c}0\\0\\1\end{array}\right)).
$$
After some thought,
it seems that a good $S$ would be something like 
$$\phantom{ S = \textmd{Span}(\left(\begin{array}{c}0\\1\\1\end{array}\right)).}$$
The goal is to recreate something similar in the general case. Hopefully the fact that 
$\textmd{dim}(U) = \textmd{dim}(W)$ will be needed somewhere.
